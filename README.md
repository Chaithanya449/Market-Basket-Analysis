This project applies the Apriori Algorithm for Market Basket Analysis — a data mining technique used to uncover hidden patterns and associations between items purchased together.It helps businesses understand customer purchasing behavior and make data-driven decisions such as:Product placement and store layoutCross-selling and promotional bundlingPersonalized recommendationsImagine a customer's shopping cart:Our goal is to understand the relationships between these items.🧩 Project PurposeThe main goal of this project is to analyze an online retail dataset to identify frequent item combinations. By generating association rules, we can determine:Which items often appear together in a transaction.How strongly they are related, measured by Support, Confidence, and Lift.This type of analysis is widely used in retail, e-commerce, and inventory management to boost sales and improve marketing strategies.⚙️ Working ProcessData Preparation:The dataset (Online retail.xlsx) is loaded, containing an initial 7,500 transactions.To ensure a clean analysis, duplicates are removed, reducing the dataset to 5,175 unique transactions.Missing values are also handled.Data Transformation:Each transaction (a comma-separated string of items) is split into a list of individual items.The TransactionEncoder from mlxtend converts these lists into a one-hot encoded DataFrame (True/False for item presence), which is the required format for the Apriori algorithm.Apriori Algorithm:The Apriori algorithm is applied to the one-hot encoded data to find frequent itemsets.A minimum support threshold of 0.003 (0.3%) is set.This means only itemsets that appear in at least 16 transactions (5,175 unique transactions $\times$ 0.003) are considered "frequent."Association Rule Generation:Using the association_rules() function, we generate rules from the frequent itemsets.Rules are filtered to find strong and meaningful associations using:Confidence $\ge$ 0.20 (20%)Lift > 3.0Results Interpretation:The final output shows the top frequent items and the strongest association rules, sorted by Lift.📊 Key Metrics ExplainedMetricMeaningFormulaSupportThe percentage of transactions that contain an itemset. (Measures popularity)$\text{Support}(A) = \frac{\text{Count}(A)}{\text{Total Transactions}}$ConfidenceThe probability that item B is bought, given that item A was bought. (Measures reliability)$\text{Confidence}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Support}(A \cup B)}{\text{Support}(A)}$LiftThe strength of the rule, measuring how much more likely B is bought when A is bought, compared to random chance. (Measures strength of association) 
 (Lift > 1 means a positive association)$\text{Lift}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Support}(A \cup B)}{\text{Support}(A) \times \text{Support}(B)}$
